        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>My name is Justin Xiao. I was born in Troy, MI, and I graduated high school in 2021. I went to Troy High School</p>
        <h3>Where am I now?</h3>
        <p>Right not, I am a sophomore at the <b>University of Michigan</b> studying <i>computer science</i>. 
            I am interested in <strong>web development</strong>, and I would like to learn more about other 
            areas of computer science as well!</p>
        <h3>What do I want to do in the future?</h3>
        <p>I want to become a full time <strong>software engineer</strong> in the future. I've accepted an offer
            to become a full time technology intern at <strong>Carmax</strong> for the summer of 2023, where I hope
            to grow my skillset and become a better programmer and problem solver.
        </p>
        <p>I'm not sure which area of software engineering I would work best in yet, which is why
            I'm <em>very</em> open to learning more about different fields.
        </p>
        <h3>Things I like to do</h3>

            <li>FC Barcelona</li>
            <li>Detroit Tigers</li>
        </ul>
